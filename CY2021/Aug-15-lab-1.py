# Assign value of 10 to x:
x = 10
# Assign value of (x + 2) to x:
x = x + 2
#
print(x)
#
# Now combine the Assignment operator (=), with the Addition operator (+):
x += 2
print(x)
#
# Now combine the Assignment operator (=), with the Minus operator (-):
x -= 2
print(x)

# This work with all 7 Operators shown in Aug 8 lab.
