# Here is an example of SINGLE (') and DOUBLE (") quotes escaped in a triple-quoted sentence: 
Line = """He said: "Hello, I've got a question." as he raised hs hand."""
# print(Line)

# This exercise prints out a string variable in all lower, then all-upper case:
String_3 = "Hello World!" 
# print(String_3.lower())
# print(String_3.upper())

# This string operation produces '10', as the number of printable characters at which the letter 'd'
# is found in "Hello World".
# print(String_3.find('d'))

# This string operation replaces character 'H' with 'J' and prints the ouput.
# print(String_3.replace("H", "J"))

# This string operation does these steps:
# 1. prints variable String_3
# 2. inserts a comment
# 3. runs the len() function on variable String_3
# 4. prints the string length. (12 characters in Hello World!, including the non-printing blank.)
# print(String_3 , "-> This string Length is:" , len(String_3))
